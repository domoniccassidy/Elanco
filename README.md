## Introduction
Elanco wants to explore the use of cloud-based cognitive services to complete text analysis on receipts to improve our customer experiences.

We believe this can be achieved by accelerating our rebates process, which today requires our customers to complete multiple forms incorporating details from multiple
receipts/products. 

## Task
Using Azure Cognitive Services, build a web-based application which represents the use of image-to-text to extract and display key details from product images and receipts.
Elanco will provide sample images of test receipts/products and weâ€™d like to see which useful data we can programmatically extract and display in a web interface to validate this approach to streamlining the customer experience.

## New Requirements and Requirement Changes

There have been new requirements added by the client. Essentially, the client wants every field on the rebate form
to be auto-filled. This can be achieved by adding a login/register functionality where a customer account contains 
additional details such as:
* First name and surname
* Email address
* Address
* Multiple pets

The client wants to replace the pet input field to an image of the customer's pet(s). Where the user can select an image of their pet.
